# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

* Object -relational Mappers(ORMS)
code library used to automate the automtic transfer of relational databases to object more commonly used in application codes. ORMs represent a bridge between the tables, relationships and fields of relational databases and Python objects.

Usefulness of ORMs
Allows developers to use Python to create, read, update and delete, instead of MYSQL in basesdata. This means programmers can use the language they are comfortable instead of writing SQL schemas and procedures.

Downsides of ORM
complexities in databases can be transferred to application code
Reduced performance
Impedance mismatch.
